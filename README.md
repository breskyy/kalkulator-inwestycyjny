# Investment Calculator and Dividend Income Predictor

This is a web-based investment calculator designed to help users predict future dividend yields and visualize the potential growth of their income from stocks over time.

## Features

- **Initial Investment Input**: Users can enter their starting investment amount.
- **Regular Contribution Input**: Users can specify how much they plan to regularly contribute (monthly, quarterly, or annually).
- **Investment Growth Projection**: Calculates the total investment value over time based on user inputs such as interest rate, compounding frequency, and contribution frequency.
- **Dividend Income Prediction**: Simulates the growth of dividend income over a period (up to 30 years) based on the number of shares owned, dividend per share, and share price.
- **Interactive Results**: The app generates a table displaying detailed calculations for each time period, including contributions, total amount invested, interest earned, and overall growth.
- **Dynamic Graphs** (Optional for Future): Can visualize the projected growth of the investment and dividend income over time.

## How It Works

1. **Enter Initial Investment**: The user provides an initial lump sum investment.
2. **Set Regular Contributions**: Enter how much will be added regularly (monthly, quarterly, or yearly).
3. **Select Compounding Frequency**: Choose how often the interest should be compounded (daily, monthly, quarterly, or yearly).
4. **Dividend Yield**: Set the dividend per share and watch the calculator predict future dividend income growth over time as more shares are accumulated.
5. **Calculate**: After entering all inputs, the app will show detailed results including total value, dividends earned, and the return on investment (ROI).
6. **Toggle Results**: Users can show/hide results for easier navigation.

- `scripts/script.js`: JavaScript logic to handle calculations for investment growth and dividend prediction.
  
## Example

If you start with an initial investment of $1000 and invest an additional $300 monthly with a dividend yield of 0.44, this app will help you visualize how your investment and dividend income grow over time.

## Future Improvements

- **Visualization**: Add charts and graphs to better visualize the predicted growth of investments and dividend income.
- **User Profiles**: Enable users to save their calculations and compare different investment strategies.
